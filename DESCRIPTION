Description: Provides computational tools for working with the Extended Laplace distribution, 
  including the probability density function, cumulative distribution function, quantile function, random variate generation based on convolution with Uniform noise and the QQ-plot. Useful for modeling 
  contaminated Laplace data and other applications in robust statistics.
